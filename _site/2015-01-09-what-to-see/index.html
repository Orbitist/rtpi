<p>As mentioned above, when the power plant is online and keeping water open in the immediately vicinity impressive flocks of Common Goldeneyes, Common Mergansers, Buffleheads, and diving ducks such as Canvasback and Greater and Lesser Scaup can be found here. Twenty species in one day are not uncommon. A few White-winged Scoters and Long-tailed Ducks often join the more common waterfowl, and rarities like Eared Grebe, Harlequin Duck, and King or Common Eider should be watched for.</p>

<p>Uncommon gulls that occasionally occur include Glaucous and Iceland. Black-legged Kittiwake is rare, but regular and Franklin’s, Sabine, and Black-headed Gull can all be recorded. One or more Little Gulls often appear among the large flocks of Bonaparte’s Gulls that stay until the onset of severe winter weather. Snowy Owls and Purple Sandpipers appear nearly annually on the breakwater, and Peregrine Falcon can be spotted hunting these large groups of birds as well.</p>

<p>In spring huge rafts of migrating Red-breasted Mergansers occur in the harbor, along with Common and Caspian Terns. Late summer brings Forster’s Terns and limited numbers of shorebirds to the area, from Willets to Baird’s Sandpipers. During fall migration good flights of Double-crested Cormorants, Red-throated Loons, Red-necked Grebes and good flights of Common Loons may be observed, and a brief flight of Brant occurs in late October or early November. Surprises may turn up at any time of year at such a location. Northern Gannet, American Avocet, and Great Gray Owl have all been recorded at Dunkirk Harbor.</p>
